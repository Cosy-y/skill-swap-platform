# Security Guidelines 🔒

## ⚠️ Important Security Notice

This project contains sensitive Firebase credentials that must be protected. Please follow these guidelines to ensure your deployment is secure.

## 🔑 Firebase Credentials

### What NOT to commit:
- `backend/firebase.json` - Contains private keys and sensitive credentials
- Any files with actual service account keys
- Database connection strings with credentials

### What IS safe to commit:
- `backend/firebase.json.template` - Template file with placeholder values
- All other project files

## 🛡️ Production Security Checklist

### Before deploying to production:

#### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] Move Firebase credentials to environment variables
- [ ] Use `.env` files for local development
- [ ] Configure production environment variables on hosting platform

#### 2. Database Security
- [ ] Configure Firestore security rules
- [ ] Limit database access to authenticated users only
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Set up backup strategies

#### 3. API Security
- [ ] Update CORS settings for production domain
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add input sanitization

#### 4. Authentication
- [ ] Use strong password requirements
- [ ] Implement session timeouts
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication (optional)
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious login attempts

#### 5. Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error logging
- [ ] Monitor API usage
- [ ] Track failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Set up alerts for unusual activity

## 🚨 If Credentials Are Compromised

If you accidentally commit Firebase credentials:

1. **Immediately rotate the service account key**:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
   - Delete the compromised key
   - Generate a new key

2. **Update your project**:
   - Replace the old credentials with new ones
   - Update environment variables
   - Restart your application

3. **Review access logs**:
   - Check Firebase Console for unusual activity
   - Monitor database for unauthorized changes

## 🔐 Best Practices

### For Development
```bash
# Use environment variables
export FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"

# Or use .env file (add to .gitignore)
echo "FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id" > .env
```

### For Production
- Use your hosting platform's environment variable system
- Never store credentials in code
- Use secrets management services when possible
- Regularly rotate credentials

## 🔍 Security Auditing

Regularly audit your application:
- Review Firebase security rules
- Check for dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- Monitor authentication logs
- Test for common web vulnerabilities

## 📞 Reporting Security Issues
